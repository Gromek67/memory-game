## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Rules

The goal of the game is to find 8 pairing cards. You can click a card and reveal its symbol, then you can click another card and reveal its symbol too. If the two cards match, you found a pair and the cards stay revealed, if not the cards turn back. The game will end when all the 8 pairs is found.
The game counts your moves. The revealing two cards count as one move. If you use an amount of moves you lose one star and later another one. The better is to accomplish the game with the least moves. You can see your score, moves and your time in the top of the game. 
You can restart the game at any time with the restart button on the top right corner. When the game end, you can see your score and time.
